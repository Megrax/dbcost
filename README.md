# DB Cost

## Background
The market lacks a tool for developers to compare different database products before making a final decision. A site, where all available RDS's performance and cost can be demonstrated, is highly wanted.

## Tech Stack (at least this is expected)

+ **Golang** in Backend
+ **Vue** in Frontend.
+ **Terraform** for infra management.
+ **Profilers** such as tpcc.
+ **Docker** for image packaging (Backend, Terraform, profilers).
+ **Cron** task  by **Render**.
+ **JSON-Schema** for schema （ideally, the whole project's data would be stored as json files）
